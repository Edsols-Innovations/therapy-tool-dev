Actions speak louder than words.
A picture is worth a thousand words.
Better late than never.
Birds of a feather flock together.
A stitch in time saves nine.
Honesty is the best policy.
The early bird catches the worm.
A penny saved is a penny earned.
Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
Two heads are better than one.
Practice makes perfect.
Where there's a will, there's a way.
A watched pot never boils.
You can't judge a book by its cover.
Rome wasn't built in a day.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
You reap what you sow.
A rolling stone gathers no moss.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you.
Look before you leap.
The grass is always greener on the other side.
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
Necessity is the mother of invention.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
Too many cooks spoil the broth.
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
Beggars can't be choosers.
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink.
Time heals all wounds.
Blood is thicker than water.
Don't cry over spilled milk.
Haste makes waste.
Laughter is the best medicine.
A fool and his money are soon parted.
Good things come to those who wait.
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
All that glitters is not gold.
Necessity knows no law.
Fortune favors the bold.
It takes two to tango.
The best things in life are free.
You can't have your cake and eat it too.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
The squeaky wheel gets the grease.
Out of sight, out of mind.
There's no place like home.
A friend in need is a friend indeed.
Strike while the iron is hot.
The pot calling the kettle black.
A penny for your thoughts.
The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence.
Better safe than sorry.
Bite the bullet.
Barking up the wrong tree.
Break the ice.
Burning the midnight oil.
Don't judge a book by its cover.
Don't make a mountain out of a molehill.
Don't put off until tomorrow what you can do today.
Every dog has its day.
Give credit where credit is due.
Give someone an inch and they'll take a mile.
Hindsight is 20/20.
Ignorance is bliss.
It takes a village to raise a child.
Kill two birds with one stone.
Let sleeping dogs lie.
Let the cat out of the bag.
Lightning never strikes the same place twice.
Like father, like son.
Look before you leap.
Money doesn't grow on trees.
No man is an island.
No news is good news.
Old habits die hard.
Once bitten, twice shy.
One man's trash is another man's treasure.
Opportunity doesn't knock twice.
Out of the frying pan and into the fire.
People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.
Practice what you preach.
Rome wasn't built in a day.
Still waters run deep.
The early bird catches the worm.
The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
Time flies when you're having fun.
To err is human, to forgive divine.
Too many cooks spoil the broth.
Two wrongs don't make a right.
Variety is the spice of life.
Waste not, want not.
What goes around comes around.
When the going gets tough, the tough get going.
Where there's smoke, there's fire.
